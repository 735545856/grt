#Gesture Recognition Toolkit Change Log

This file contains some notes about significant changes to the GRT.

## 18th September 2014 
- **build support moved from 'make' to 'cmake'**. You can now build the toolkit using a CMakeLists file, which will autogenerate a makefile for your system.  See the readme file in the build directory for more information.
