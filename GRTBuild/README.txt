# This folder contains an example Makefile for building the GRT (as a static library) and also for building the GRT examples.
# This Makefile currently works on Linux/OSX, Windows support will be added soon.
# To build the GRT and examples, install make (http://www.gnu.org/software/make/) and then:
# (1) Open terminal and cd to the directory containing this file
# (2) type: make
# (3) make will now build the GRT library (libgrt.a) and also build the GRT examples (which will be placed in the folder GRTExamples)
# (4) To run any of the examples, cd into the GRTExamples folder and then run: ./ExampleName.out
# If you just want to build the GRT as a library to use in your own projects then type: make grtlib
